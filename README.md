### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- A flashcard game that is playable on the terminal. The game contains 30 cards that have possible answers to choose from. As the user guesses, feedback is provided to let the user know if their answer is correct or incorrect. When the user has gone through the whole deck, a promt shows up telling the user that the round is over and give the calculated percentage of questions answered correctly.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Clone the SSH code from this [link](https://github.com/rae-107/flashcard-project) to your local computer
- Open in your text editor 
- Read the README.md 
- In the terminal, run the command 'node index.js" for interaction with game

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
